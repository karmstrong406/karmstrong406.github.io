            <h1>Seasons Ebb Away</h1>
            <h2>Jenny Kelley</h2>
            <p></p>
            <p>As I sat on my back porch in my rocking chair today, I could see, feel and smell summer ebbing away.</p>
            <p>I could hear the wind blowing softly through the trees. I could even see a few falling leaves.</p>
            <p>I can tell by the shorter days that fall is on the way. The hot, lazy days of summer aren’t going to stay.</p>
            <p>Blissful spring has come and gone.</p>
            <p> The remaining days of sleepy summer won’t last long.</p>
            <p>Glorious fall colors will soon appear.</p>
            <p>But, like the flowers of summer they will disappear.</p>
            <p> Winter will follow the fall as it always has. </p>
            <p>Spring, summer and fall are again</p>
            <p> Part of the past.</p>
            <p>People can be compared to the seasons.</p>
            <p> They are born, bloom, and ebb away.</p>
            <p> Like spring, summer, and fall they cannot stay.</p>
            <p> Winter will come as it always does.</p>
            <p> If we are blessed, we have experienced the
                seasons at their best. </p>
