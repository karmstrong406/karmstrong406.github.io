<h1>State Review</h1>

<body>
    <h1><a href="https://www.tn.gov">Tennessee</a></h1>
    <p>This is my favorite site. It is clean, has quick and easy links, lots of photos of people and is organized well. You can easily navigate between topics and are able to search for what you are looking for. It also resizes well for different sized screens. </p>
    <h1> <a href="https://www.vermont.gov">Vermont</a></h1>
    <p> Vermont comes in a close second to Tennessee. It also has quick and easily located links, great and diverse photos, and quick information along with resizing well. The one drawback, in the navigation bar, you can't hover over a drop down menu as most websites do. Instead you have to click on the word to dropdown the menu. That threw me off. </p>
    <h1> <a href="https://alaska.gov">Alaska</a></h1>
    <p>This is a nice looking website, very informative. There are quick links to get to what might be needed most and quickly. It has easy links to social media which is becoming more popular and is thus a good idea to include. My one critic is that the page doesn't resize with the sceen size. It is easy to clink on links to go to other government websites such as publis safety but it opens in the same tab instead of a new tab and doesn't have a quick link back to the main state site. The navigation bar is easy to navigate though there are almost too many. </p>
    <h1><a href="https://www.iowa.gov">Iowa</a></h1>
    <p>Iowa definitely naviagates easier than Alaska. I like the structure of this page a lot. I think the header is a bit big but it sets a nice style tone for the rest of the page. The color scheme picks a different color for teh different big topics and then branches off for related topic to similar colors, that makes it a lot easier to navigate. What I liked so much about Alaska was the pictures of the state, Iowa doesn't have state-specific photos but uses a lot of generic photos. It does size well on different screens. </p>
    <h1> <a href="https://www.ok.gov">Oklahoma</a></h1>
    <p>Oklahoma was my least favorite website of the five. This is an older looking website. It looks clean but not very modern. It kind of sizes well... but not very smoothly. I like the idea of the scenery scroll but viewers can't actually look at each different picture because it flips through all of them so quickly and you can't slow it down. It doesn't have helpful links out in the open, viewers would have to search for it. </p>
