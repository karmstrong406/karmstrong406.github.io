        <h1> <a href="http://www.suzannecollinsbooks.com/index.htm">Suzanne Collins Books – Bad </a> </h1>
        <p>This website isn’t awful at first glance. It has a clear three column design that is ok. But with more exploration, there are many flaws. On her home page, instead of being able to quickly click into different books, we are forced to scroll. In scrolling, one sees only the book cover and a bunch of white space. Upon highlighting the section, one discovers the hidden message: reviews about the books! All typed in white! Upon a white background…? Clicking through the different tabs, she highlights her different books and gives a brief description. She uses her three-column layout well to give the book jacket on one side, the summary in the middle, and a couple of reviews on the other side. However, the reviews don’t line up with their respective book jackets and summaries. Also, her one-line descriptions under the book covers are not only unnecessary, but, in one case for sure, are inaccurate. Her next tab is a biography which is well and good but keeps the reviews of her books still running on the right-hand column where white space – or beige space to be more accurate – would have looked cleaner. Her final tab is an interview done with Scholastic Press, but it is unclear what the topic of this interview is or when it was done. This tab, again, has running reviews of her works when it should be beige space. She keeps to a clear branding with a simple color scheme and basic fonts, but the colors aren’t picked from an over-arching theme, it’s a seemingly random choice. She codes for having social media links but I see none…? It doesn’t look like a very clean code, pretty simple.</p>

        <h1> <a href="https://www.jkrowling.com">J.K. Rowling – Good</a> </h1>
        <p> This website is beautifully done. Her home page is a scrolling photo with news updates. The objects in the photo line up well with where the links are and are tastefully spread out. The Nav bar follows the scroll so that even from the bottom of the page you can click to a different tab. The tabs are simple with the option for more by selecting a button. The news tab has up to date info on Rowling’s work with her various charities, her awards, and other such information. There is a tab with various answers to frequently asked questions for Rowling. The next tab covers her different “writings” and by clicking on the book cover, viewers can see brief information on the book. The last tab has Rowling’s biography. On all of these pages, the headers and footers pull from the scrolling photo of the home page. They have nice margins and a clear, simple color scheme to create a very clean and easy to follow page that attracts the eye.</p>

        <h1> <a href="https://veronicarothbooks.com">Veronica Roth – Good </a> </h1>
        <p> This website is also very clearly designed and easy to follow. Roth’s website is separated throughout and consistently by angled lines. Her header in her home page is a slide show of photos that viewers can click through. The home page also has info for her latest book and the latest movie trailer of her books. There is also a subscription section and a footer that mimics the nav bar at the top. Her books tab, when clicking into one of her books has a really neat design where there is a small scroll for the summary of the book in the header. The header is themed to match the cover of the book. Roth’s bio, classroom, and contact tabs have similar designs that follow the same theme as the website. The news tab has the same angled header with the body filled with different news headings cleanly separated by lines. Her events tab follows the same layout. The code looks very complex due to the many linked pages and coding that I don’t understand. </p>
